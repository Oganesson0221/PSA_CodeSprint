The steps to run it the website

1. Open in VS code (can clone using GitHub desktop I feel it’s easier that way)
2. Double click on frontend and open in the integrated terminal and in the terminal type “npm run dev”
3. Similarly double click backend and open in integrated terminal and type “node —watch app” 

4. To run the ML model, open the flask_model_app in the integrated terminal and type “python app.py”. Make sure you have downloaded venv packages and files into your environment before you run it.
